# Current Version:
1.0 (beta)

## Changes & Fixes
- Backend optimization via IO lib. Flickering when refreshing the canvas, adding objects, or enabling gridlines is now fixed.
- Save figures as .tiff, .eps., .pdf, .png, and .jpeg
- Save diagram projects as .json and be able to load files into the program to pick up where you left off
- Fluid canvas size for figure size and journal requirements
- Variable zoom function for canvas fit and fine tuning
- Export preview window
- Rectangle and ellipses node support added
- Object tuning (gap, curvature, aspect) added
- More color options (hex support)


## Future Goals
- Fine object selection (nodes, edges, plates, text, etc) via the mouse cursor
- Object grouping selection
- Floating text
- Parameter description/legend addition(s)
- Multipanel figure configuration with adaptive titles and labels
- UI/UX improvements (UI is currently a little dense, missing some necessary options)
- User-preferred keybind options
- Advanced color picker
- MacOS support as an application
